            <p>
              I, <a href="./introduction.html">David D. James</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2026
              WEB115-N850 Web
              Markup and Scripting with my
              instructor, Asatha Saxena.</p>

            <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the
              world.
              I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

            <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As
              such,
              failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

            <p>Signed: <em>David D. James, 18 January 2026</em></p>
