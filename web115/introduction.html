      <p>Hey, my name is <strong><em>David</em></strong>.I am in my second-to-last semester at CPCC, working towards an
        IT - App. Dev &
        Data Analysis degree. I love collecting vinyl records and playing video games with my friends. Programming
        has always been a passion of mine since I was a kid, and I hope to be able to do it for the rest of my life. To
        me, programming is a art form just like painting or poetry; the best programmers can create unique solutions
        to problems, either using existing tools or creating new ones from scratch</p>
