            Hey, my name is David. I am in my final semester at CPCC, working
            towards an IT – App. Dev & Data Analysis degree. I love collecting vinyl records and playing video games
            with my friends.
            Programming has always been a passion of mine since I was a kid, and I hope to be able to do it for the rest
            of
            my life. To me, programming is an art from just like painting or poetry; the best programmers can create
            unique
            solutions to problems, either using existing tools or new ones from scratch.
